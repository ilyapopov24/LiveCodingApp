# Product Context: LiveCodingApp

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
The Rick and Morty universe contains hundreds of characters, but there's no dedicated mobile application that provides a clean, efficient way to browse through them. Users currently rely on:
- Scrolling through long lists on websites
- Inconsistent character information across different sources
- No offline access to character data
- Poor mobile experience on existing platforms

### Solution
LiveCodingApp provides a dedicated Android application that:
- **Simplifies Character Discovery**: Clean, paginated interface for browsing characters
- **Ensures Consistency**: Single source of truth for character information
- **Enables Offline Access**: Local caching for viewing characters without internet
- **Optimizes Mobile Experience**: Native Android app designed for mobile devices

## How It Should Work

### Core User Journey
1. **App Launch**: User opens the app and sees a loading state
2. **Initial Load**: First page of characters loads from API and displays
3. **Character Browsing**: User scrolls through character list with names and images
4. **Pagination**: As user reaches the bottom, next page automatically loads
5. **Offline Access**: Previously viewed characters remain accessible without internet
