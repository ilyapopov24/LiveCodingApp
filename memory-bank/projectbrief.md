# Project Brief: LiveCodingApp

## Project Overview
**LiveCodingApp** is an Android application designed to display Rick and Morty characters in a user-friendly, paginated interface. The app demonstrates modern Android development practices and clean architecture principles.

## Core Requirements
- Display Rick and Morty characters in a scrollable list
- Support pagination for large character datasets
- Provide offline functionality through local caching
- Implement clean, maintainable code architecture
- Use modern Android development tools and libraries

## Project Goals
1. **User Experience**: Create an intuitive interface for browsing character information
2. **Performance**: Implement efficient data loading and caching
3. **Maintainability**: Follow clean architecture principles for long-term code quality
4. **Modern Development**: Utilize current Android development best practices
5. **Scalability**: Design for future feature additions and improvements

## Success Criteria
- App successfully displays character data from the Rick and Morty API
- Smooth pagination experience with proper loading states
- Offline functionality through local database caching
- Clean, testable codebase following architectural patterns
- Responsive UI that works across different device sizes

## Target Audience
- Android developers learning clean architecture
- Users interested in Rick and Morty character information
- Developers studying modern Android development practices

## Project Scope
**In Scope:**
- Character listing with pagination
- API integration with Rick and Morty service
- Local data caching
- Basic character information display (name, image)
- Clean architecture implementation

**Out of Scope (Future Considerations):**
- Character detail views
- Search functionality
- User preferences
- Advanced filtering options
- Character favorites system

## Technology Constraints
- **Platform**: Android only (minimum API level TBD)
- **Language**: Kotlin
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture with MVVM
- **Dependencies**: Hilt, Retrofit, Room, LiveData, ViewBinding
- **Build System**: Gradle with Kotlin DSL

## Timeline
- **Current Phase**: MVP implementation with basic functionality
- **Next Phase**: UI improvements and error handling
- **Future Phase**: Additional features and optimizations

This project serves as both a functional application and a learning resource for modern Android development practices.
